<p style="font-size:20px; text-indent:6px; text-decoration:underline; color:RGB(103, 27, 179); background-color:RGB(0, 255, 153)">Tennis is a racket sport that can be played individually against a single opponent (singles) or between two teams of two players each (doubles). Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with 
<u style="color:orange">cord</u> to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with <u style="color:orange">felt</u> over or around a net and into the opponent's court. The object of the game is to <u style="color:orange">maneuver </u>the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return. The player who is unable to return the ball will not gain a point, while the opposite player will.
<br>
Tennis comes from the French tenez, the plural imperative form of the verb tenir, to hold, meaning "hold!", "receive!" or "take!", an interjection used as a call from the server to his opponent to indicate that he is about to serve.In 1873, Londoner Major Walter Wingfield invented a game called he called Sphairistikè (Greek for "playing ball"). Played on an hourglass-shaped court, Wingfield's game created a sensation in Europe, the United States, and even China, and is the source from which tennis as we know it today eventually evolved.

<p style="font-size:20px; color:blue; font-family:"Comic Sans""><b>Tennis is an Olympic sport and is played at all levels of society and at all ages. The sport can be played by anyone who can hold a racket, including wheelchair users. The modern game of tennis originated in Birmingham, England, in the late 19th century as lawn tennis.[1] It had close connections both to various field (lawn) games such as croquet and bowls as well as to the older racket sport today called real tennis. During most of the 19th century, in fact, the term tennis referred to real tennis, not lawn tennis.
The net like structure of racket is the gutting.</b></p>
